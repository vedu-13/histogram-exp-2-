Histogram Equalization is a technique used in image processing to enhance the contrast of an image. It works by redistributing the intensity levels of the image's pixels so that the histogram (graph of pixel intensity values) is more evenly spread out. This helps to improve the visibility of details in both dark and light areas of an image.
